This folder contains information on the boundaries of carceral facilities (prisons, jails, and immigrant detention centers etc.) in the U.S. and the preparation of a prison-specific dataset.

**Carceral Facilities Boundaries Data:** The initial raw dataset of 6,738 carceral facilities boundaries was imported from the [Department of Homeland Security](https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/2d6109d4127d458eaf0958e4c5296b67_0/downloads/data?format=geojson&spatialRefId=4326&where=1%3D1) (DHS)  using a GeoJSON file, hosted on [this website](https://hifld-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::prison-boundaries/explore?location=1.207416,-9.852691,0.97). This dataset includes the geographic boundaries and attributes of "secure detention facilities" (in American states and territories) which includes prisons, jails, detention centers, re-entry facilities, jails, juvenile detention centers and more. 

**Clean List of Prisons:** A clean list of prisons [state_fed_prisons.csv](./state_fed_prisons.csv) is provided from a CSV file containing FACILITYID values as strings. This list was used to filter the raw dataset to include only prisons. Filtering down to prisons was done in [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) by Dr. Ufuoma Ovienmhada. The final dataset included 1,614 facilities (24% of DHS dataset) which is close to the number of state and federal adult correctional facilities reported by the [BJS Census](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/census-state-and-federal-adult-correctional-facilities-2019-statistical-tables) in 2019.

The dataset was filtered to only include facilities under state, federal, multi, or unknown jurisdictions that were open as of June 2020 (the last reported update by DHS). Then, facilities that were deemed to be different from prisons (i.e., either in function, population, or infrastructure) were manually excluded. For example, this process excluded Residential Reentry Centers (also referred to as "halfway houses"). While [halfway houses are rife with problematic conditions](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/09/03/halfway/), they can range from more residential style homes to more carceral infrastructure with locked doors. The populations in halfway houses can also be quite transient, housed for short or long time periods. We wanted to focus the analysis of environmental risk factors in specifically prisons, which are often housing people for long periods of time in old infrastructure built of masonry materials, with high restrictions on movement. Future work should investigate other types of carceral facilities beyond prisons.

**Sources of Error:** As the filtering was done manually, there are certainly potential errors in the list of prisons. Some anticipated sources of error may stem from:
- Facilities that have shuttered/closed fown in the past can be reopened. In some cases, the populations shift over time by sex, or by function (e.g. criminal versus immigrant detention).
- New facilities may have opened since the time of the lasy update by the DHS in 2020
- In some places, a facility is colloquially described as a prison but may officially be categorized in another way

We hope this work can be a starting point for future refinement of specific types of carceral facilities to enable more detailed research.
