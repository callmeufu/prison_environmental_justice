# Prison environmental justice

This is the working repository for an ongoing research project supported by NASA ROSES-21 A.49 Earth Science Applications: Equity and Environmental Justice funded grant (Award No 80NSSC22K1673) titled "EVDT Integrated Modeling Framework Applied to Measure Environmental Injustice and Socioeconomic Disparities in Prison Landscapes" and a grant from MITâ€™s IDSS Initiative on Combating Systemic Racism. The purpose of this project is to develop time-series datasets and analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of prison exposure to air pollution, air temperature, land surface temperature, and other environmental risk factors.

This repository describes the workflow used to carry out the spatial analysis, from data retrieval to producing the final datasets that are hosted (here). Below are further details on the repository structure, how to use the code, and data sources. Please send any questions reguarding this repository to Ufuoma Ovienmhada (ufuoma@mit.edu).

## Folder Descriptions
- `prison_datasets` Includes data in geographic boundaries of carceral facilities (prisons, jails, and immigrant detention center) and a prison specific dataset
- `daymet_air_temp` Includes python code and output data using the [Daymet v4](https://daymet.ornl.gov/overview) air temperature model to compute statistics in prison landscapes

We thank the Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons for their research collaboration and for the formerly incarcerated interviewees that motivate and inform this work.
