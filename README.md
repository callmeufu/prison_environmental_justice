# Prison environmental justice

This is the working repository for a NASA ROSES-21 A.49 Earth Science Applications: Equity and Environmental Justice funded project (Award No 80NSSC22K1465) titled "EVDT Integrated Modeling Framework Applied to Measure Environmental Injustice and Socioeconomic Disparities in Prison Landscapes".

This repository describes the workflow used to carry out the spatial analysis, from data retrieval to producing the final datasets that are hosted (here). Below are further details on the repository structure, how to use the code, and data sources.

Please send any questions reguarding this project and code base to Caitlin Mothes (ufuoma@mit.edu)
